      <h3 id="quote"><em>"Sometimes a player's greatest challenge is coming to grips with his role on the team" - Scottie Pippen, 2005</em></h3>
      <h2> Early years</h2>
      <p>Scottie Maurice Pippen was an NBA player drafted 5th overall in the 1987 NBA Draft by the Seattle SuperSonics and was traded to the Chicago Bulls right away. Some people may know him as the “Robin” to Michael Jordan’s “Batman.” Pippen was an individual who was also known for his accolades throughout his NBA career, but is often overlooked and forgotten due to being in the shadow of his teammate known as the greatest of all time (or GOAT). What a lot of people didn’t know was that the GOAT (drafted 1984 3rd overall) did not go past the first round of the playoffs until Pippen was drafted. The team eventually found their groove and accomplished their first “three-peat” (three championships in a row) during the years 1991-1993. Michael Jordan then retired after this success.</p>

      <h2> Dream Team </h2>

      <p>Pippen was part of the Dream Team during the 1992 Olympics. The Dream Team was formed due to regulations in the Olympics finally allowing professional athletes to participate instead of only allowing college students and other non-professionals.</p>

      <h2> Pippen Without Jordan </h2>
      <p>During Pippen’s tenure leading the Bulls after Jordan retired, it was up to him to lead the team. Throughout the season they finished with 55 wins, two fewer than the previous season with Jordan. Unfortunately they lost to the New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference finals. Despite the fact that they did not win the finals after Jordan's first retirement, Pippen showcased himself as a player outside of Jordan's shadow. Pippen also finished fourth place in MVP voting, that being a testament to his accolades as an individual player who can lead a team by himself. The two NBA seasons without Jordan was won by Hakeem Olajuwon and the Rockets.</p>

      <h2>Jordan Returns: Second Three-Peat 1995-1998</h2>
      <p> With the return of Michael Jordan and the signing of the two-time NBA champion Dennis Rodman, the Bulls set the record for the most wins in an NBA season (72-10 @ 1995-1996), this record would hold until the Golden State Warriors surpassed it with 73-9 during the 2015-2016 NBA season. The 1995-1996 season was widely considered the best season for the Chicago Bulls franchise, although a second-three peat was achieved and Jordan's bulls are known to have a 6-0 finals record. After the three-peat, Michael Jordan will retire for a second time, and this concludes this particular dynasty.</p>

      <h2> Aftermath </h2>
      <p> There wasn't much left to do after the end of such an amazing dynasty. However, Pippen was traded to the Houston Rockets, and then traded to the Portland Trail Blazers, only to come back to the Bulls as a veteran in the year 2003. However, despite being someone who signed with his old team in order to guide the younger players, an aging Pippen acquired injuries which confined him to playing 23 games during the season, ending the season with a 23-59 record. This has been known as the very first time Pippen never made the playoffs. </p>
